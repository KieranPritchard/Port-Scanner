## Project Description

### Objective

This is a simple Python-based port scanner built with the socket module.
It was created as a portfolio project to demonstrate working with sockets in Python and to learn more about network programming fundamentals.

### Technology and Tools Used

* **Language:** Python.
* **Framework/Library:** Sockets.
* **Tools:** git, VS Code, ChatGPT (For the idea and debugging help).

### Challenges Faced

* Timeout causing an error, this was because i put in `timeout(0.5)` instead of `settimeout(0.5)`

### Outcome

Built a Python socket-based port scanner capable of scanning both the most commonly used network ports and all ports in a specified range, providing real-time results on port status.

## How to Use the Project

### 1. Install Python

* Make sure Python 3 is installed. Check with:

```
python --version
```

### 2. Download the script

* Save the code as port_scanner.py (or clone the repository).

### 3. Run the script
* In your terminal, navigate to the script’s folder and run:

```
python3 port_scanner.py
```

### 4. Choose an option

* When prompted:
    * Enter 1 to scan most commonly used ports.
    * Enter 2 to scan all ports (1–1024).

### 5. Enter target IP

* Type the IP address of the target machine (e.g., 192.168.1.1).

### 6. View results

* The program will display which ports are OPEN or CLOSED.
* Note: Scanning ports you don’t own or have permission to scan may be illegal. Always scan responsibly.
